        <h2><strong>Industry Applications of Carbon Capture and Storage Technology (CCT)</strong></h2>
        <p>Carbon Capture and Storage Technology (CCT) is of particular significance in the decarbonization of industries that are traditionally challenging to electrify or transition to renewable energy sources. These sectors, which are challenging to abate, generate substantial greenhouse gas emissions, frequently due to chemical process emissions that cannot be eliminated by energy efficiency or fuel switching alone. This article reviews key industry sectors where CCT is currently applied or holds the greatest promise, highlighting challenges, opportunities, and real-world examples.</p>
        <h3><strong>1. Power Generation</strong></h3>
        <p>Coal- and natural gas-fired power plants are recognized as significant contributors to carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. CCT has been demonstrated to capture up to 90% of CO₂ emissions from fossil-fueled power plants, thereby facilitating a transition to a more environmentally friendly energy source while contributing to grid stability. For coal-fired power plants, the implementation of Clean Coal Technologies (CCT) retrofits has the potential to prolong the operational lifespan of existing facilities under the more stringent climate change policies that are currently being implemented. In the context of gas power generation, natural gas combined cycle (CC) plants that employ the cycle with combined cycle turbine (CCT) technology have been shown to emit reduced levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in comparison to other power generation methods. Additionally, these plants offer a flexible backup for intermittent renewable energy sources, which is a crucial consideration in the broader effort to ensure a reliable and sustainable energy supply. Petra Nova (USA) is a paradigmatic example of a large-scale coal CCS project. Prior to its suspension, it was capturing over 1.6 million tons annually.</p>
        <h3><strong>2. Cement Industry</strong></h3>
        <p>The cement sector is responsible for approximately 7% of global CO₂ emissions, primarily from the calcination process (a chemical reaction that releases CO₂ from limestone). CCT is a viable option for reducing these process emissions. The utilization of technologies such as post-combustion capture and emerging calcium looping is imperative in this context. For instance, the LEILAC project (EU) is developing direct capture from kiln exhaust gases, thereby reducing energy penalties.</p>
        <h3><strong>3. Steel Manufacturing</strong></h3>
        <p>The primary sources of CO₂ emissions from steel production are coke combustion and chemical reduction in blast furnaces. The capture of these emissions by CCT provides a foundation for the attainment of emission-free steel production. A novel method that has emerged involves the use of hydrogen-based direct reduction in conjunction with CCT, a process that diverges from the conventional reduction method that utilizes coke. Additionally, CCT possesses retrofitting potential, allowing for the capture of blast furnace off-gases or coke oven emissions. The HYBRIT initiative (Sweden) has already demonstrated the integration of hydrogen and coke and coal (CCT) to produce steel with near-zero emissions.</p>
        <h3><strong>4. Chemical and Petrochemical Industry</strong></h3>
        <p>The primary sources of CO₂ emissions from steel production are coke combustion and chemical reduction in blast furnaces. The capture of these emissions by CCT provides a foundation for the attainment of emission-free steel production. A novel method that has emerged involves the use of hydrogen-based direct reduction in conjunction with CCT, a process that replaces the conventional reduction method that utilizes coke. Additionally, CCT possesses retrofitting potential, allowing for the capture of blast furnace off-gases or coke oven emissions. The HYBRIT initiative (Sweden) has already demonstrated the integration of hydrogen and coke and coal (CCT) to produce steel with near-zero emissions. The production of chemicals is associated with substantial carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, stemming from both fuel combustion and chemical processes, such as the production of ammonia and methanol. The capacity of CCT to capture emissions emanating from steam reformers and furnaces is well-documented. The challenge inherent to this process is the necessity of flexible capture solutions, given the varied emission sources and purity levels. The concepts must still be conceptualized and developed. After the capture of CO₂, it can be utilized as a feedstock for chemical synthesis or polymers.</p>
        <h3><strong>5. Natural Gas Processing</strong></h3>
        <p>Natural gas processing facilities employ a variety of methods to remove the carbon dioxide that is naturally present in raw gas. Conversely, CCT has been demonstrated to sequester this CO₂ rather than releasing it into the atmosphere. Given the substantial volume of gas processed, a notable quantity of CO₂ can be captured, which can subsequently be utilized in the context of enhanced oil recovery.</p>
        <h3><strong>6. Waste-to-Energy and Biomass Facilities</strong></h3>
        <p>Carbon Capture and Storage Technology (CCT) can capture CO₂ emissions from waste incineration or biomass combustion, thereby enabling negative emissions when biomass is sustainably sourced. Natural gas processing facilities employ a variety of methods to remove the carbon dioxide that is naturally present in raw gas. Conversely, CCT has been demonstrated to sequester this CO₂ rather than releasing it into the atmosphere. Given the substantial volume of gas processed, a notable quantity of CO₂ can be captured, which can subsequently be utilized in the context of enhanced oil recovery.</p>
        <h3><strong>7. Emerging Industrial Clusters and Hubs</strong></h3>
        <p>In industrial hubs where multiple emitters share CCT infrastructure and storage facilities, cost-effectiveness is maximized, and logistical challenges are reduced. This phenomenon is exemplified by the UK's East Coast Cluster initiative, which aims to establish interconnected pipelines for the transportation of carbon dioxide (CO₂) among the power, steel, and chemical industries. Other hubs include Rotterdam (Netherlands), Houston (USA), and Northern Lights (Norway)</p>
        <h3><strong>8. Challenges Specific to Industry CCT</strong></h3>
        <p>The industry faces numerous challenges in the field of applications. For instance, three cases are provided herein.</p>
        <p>The integration process is characterized by its intricate nature, attributable to the considerable variability inherent in industrial processes. This variability necessitates the implementation of customized capture solutions tailored to specific industrial contexts, to ensure effective data collection and processing.</p>
        <p>Significant initial investments necessitate the presence of robust financial incentives.</p>
        <p>The continuous operation of CCT systems is imperative to prevent disruptions to production. Presently, this functionality is not available.</p>
        <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
        <p>CCT is imperative for the decarbonization of heavy industry, which is responsible for a substantial portion of global emissions. Despite the challenges that persist, the ongoing advancements in technology, the policy framework, and the demonstration projects are collectively laying the foundation for more widespread adoption. The utilization of industry-specific CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) applications serves as a pivotal conduit in achieving net-zero emissions goals while preserving economic competitiveness and industrial resilience.</p>
