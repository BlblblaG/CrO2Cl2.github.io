        <h2><strong>General Overview of Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies (CCT)</strong></h2>
        <p>Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies (CCT) are a set of technologies that capture carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions at their source, typically power plants or industrial facilities, preventing them from entering the atmosphere and stores it securely underground or in other ways. Recognized by organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), CCT is</p>
        <p>essential for achieving global net-zero targets by mid-century, especially for industries where emissions are otherwise unavoidable.</p>
        <h3><strong>What CCT Involves</strong></h3>
        <p>CCT can be separated into three main stages:</p>
        <p>First up there is capturing. In this stage CO₂ is separated from other gases in the atmosphere. This can be done through post-combustion, pre-combustion, or oxy-fuel combustion. Each method suits different industrial contexts, from coal and gas-fired power plants to cement and steel factories.</p>
        <p>Secondly, there is transport: Once captured, CO₂ is compressed and transported to a suitable storage site. Usually this happens by pipeline, though shipping and rail are also possible to a suitable storage site.</p>
        <p>Third storage: The CO₂ is injected into deep geological formations, such as saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs, where it remains trapped, often for thousands of years, or the compressed gas is utilized in other plants for other purposes.</p>
        <h3><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h3>
        <p>Human activity emits over 33 gigatons (Gt) of CO₂ annually. Some emissions, like those from heavy industry, are difficult to eliminate by using renewable energy or by improving efficiency alone. CCT is currently the only scalable technology that can decarbonize sectors like Cement production (which releases CO₂ from limestone), Steel manufacturing (which uses carbon-based reduction), Hydrogen production (from fossil fuels with CCT) or Waste-to-energy facilities.</p>
        <p>CCT can also be paired with bioenergy (BECCT) or Direct Air Capture (DAC) to remove CO₂ from the atmosphere, which is crucial for offsetting residual emissions and even drawing down legacy emissions.</p>
        <h3><strong>Global Status</strong></h3>
        <p>As of 2025, over 35 commercial CCT facilities are operating globally, capturing a combined 45+ million tons of CO₂ per year. Hundreds more are under planning or construction, and the pipeline network has grown rapidly, doubling in size in just a few years.</p>
        <p>Some leading countries in CCT deployment include the United States (Driven by tax credits (45Q), the U.S. leads in both project count and CO₂ stored), Norway (Home to the Sleipner and Northern Lights projects, pioneering offshore storage), UK and Netherlands (Investing in industrial CCT hubs and CO₂ shipping).</p>
        <h3><strong>Policy and Investment</strong></h3>
        <p>CCT requires supportive regulatory and financial frameworks due to its high up-front cost. Governments and institutions are increasingly recognizing this need, the EU Innovation Fund, the US Inflation Reduction Act and Canada’s ITC (Investment Tax Credit) are incentivizing large-scale deployment.</p>
        <p>Public-private partnerships are funding shared infrastructure such as carbon capture hubs and CO₂ pipelines.</p>
        <h3><strong>Criticism and Rebuttal</strong></h3>
        <p>Critics argue that CCT could prolong fossil fuel dependency. However, supporters point out that CCT is not a substitute for renewables, but a necessary tool for sectors where emissions can’t be fully avoided. In addition, CCT can support the energy transition by cleaning up blue hydrogen and providing negative emissions when paired with biomass.</p>
        <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
        <p>CCT is not a silver bullet—but without it, achieving net zero would be far more expensive and possibly impossible. Its ability to reduce emissions from hard-to-abate sectors and even remove CO₂ from the atmosphere makes it a cornerstone of modern climate strategy. As more projects become operational and costs decrease, CCT will become an increasingly important part of global decarbonization efforts.</p>
