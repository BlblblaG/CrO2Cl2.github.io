        <h2><strong>Myths and Misconceptions About Carbon Capture Technology (CCT)</strong></h2>
        <p>Carbon Capture Technology (CCT) is a well-established technology with decades of operational experience. Yet, public debate around CCT is often clouded by misconceptions, half-truths, and ideological biases. In this article, we debunk the most commonly found myths about CCT using evidence from science, engineering, and climate policy.</p>
        <h3><strong>Myth 1: "CCT is unproven and experimental"</strong></h3>
        <p>CCT is not a science-fiction concept or an untested prototype. The first large-scale CCT project – Sleipner in Norway - has been operational since 1996, storing over 1 million tonnes of CO₂ annually in an offshore saline formation. Dozens of commercial-scale CCT facilities are now in operation around the globe.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) operations using CO₂ injection have been practiced safely since the 1970s. The geology, physics, and monitoring technologies used in CCT are mature and well understood. The "experimental" label no longer applies.</p>
        <h3><strong>Myth 2: "CCT is just a way to prolong fossil fuel use"</strong></h3>
        <p>This critique often comes from climate activists who fear that CCT is a "license to pollute." However, the purpose of CCT is not to protect fossil fuels, it is to reduce emissions from hard-to-eliminate sectors, like for example in cement and steel production, waste-to-energy incinerators, hydrogen production via reforming, in chemical plants and refineries.</p>
        <p>Many of these emit CO₂ regardless of the energy source. Additionally, Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Bioenergy with CCT (BECCT) remove CO₂ from the air - delivering net-negative emissions, not extending fossil dependence.</p>
        <h3><strong>Myth 3: "Stored CO₂ will eventually leak"</strong></h3>
        <p>CO₂ is stored in deep geological formations under layers of impermeable rock (caprock), the same kind of traps that hold oil and gas for millions of years without leakage. Once injected, CO₂ becomes dense and tends to sink, not rise. Over time, it dissolves in brine and forms stable carbonates.</p>
        <p>Modern storage sites are monitored rigorously using seismic imaging, pressure sensors, and satellite techniques. In over 25 years of operations (e.g., Sleipner, Weyburn), no significant leakage has occurred. Risk exists, but it is small and manageable.</p>
        <h3><strong>Myth 4: "CCT consumes more energy than it saves"</strong></h3>
        <p>It's true that capturing and compressing CO₂ requires energy. This "energy penalty" varies by capture technology. MEA solvents have a 15-30% effiency loss in power plants, while newer materials only have a 5-10% loss. The industrial CCT has less than 1% energy loss and is often easier to use than the other two.</p>
        <p>However, net CO₂ emissions are still reduced by 85–95% depending on system design. As capture technologies improve, the energy cost is falling - and it's often lower than alternatives like electrification of high-heat processes.</p>
        <h3><strong>Myth 5: "CCT is too expensive to be viable"</strong></h3>
        <p>Costs have dropped significantly. Early CCT projects cost $100–150 per tonne of captured CO2. Today, capturing from industrial sources can cost as little as $30–60 per tonne, and geological storage adds only $5–10. With carbon pricing, tax credits (like the U.S. 45Q), and trading schemes, CCT is becoming economically competitive - especially for sectors with few other decarbonization options.</p>
        <p>Also, compared to alternatives like hydrogen electrolysis or direct electrification, CCT is often the cheaper option, especially where infrastructure already exists.</p>
        <h3><strong>Myth 6: "CCT is a distraction from renewable energy"</strong></h3>
        <p>This is a false dichotomy. CCT and renewables are complementary, not destructive. Renewables decarbonize electricity, CCT decarbonizes industrial processes. Even in a fully renewable power grid, some emissions will remain (from materials, landfills, aviation, etc.), and CCT will be needed to offset them.</p>
        <p>Without CCT, many net-zero models (e.g., from the IEA, IPCC) require costlier and riskier interventions like mass reforestation or deep lifestyle changes.</p>
        <h3><strong>Myth 7: "Public opposition will always block CCT projects"</strong></h3>
        <p>While some CCT projects have faced local resistance (often due to poor communication or mistrust), recent surveys in the U.S., Canada, and Europe show that public support grows with better information. Transparency, community involvement, and benefits-sharing (e.g., jobs, investment) improve acceptance dramatically.</p>
        <p>In conclusion CCT is not a panacea, but neither are fossil industry scams. It is a rigorously tested, deeply necessary tool to decarbonize difficult sectors and achieve climate targets. The myths surrounding CCT often ignore nuances and technical facts. By dispelling these misconceptions, we can have a more productive conversation about how best to integrate CCT into a larger climate solution portfolio.</p>
